Polar Wander is the apparent movement of a satellite's rotational pole due to nonsynchronous reorientation of the satellite's crust. \
If a satellite's crust is not coupled to its core, it may experience nonsynchronous rotation (NSR). \
Sometimes, this also results in a reorientation of the poles. \
The north pole appears to wander over the surface as the crust reorients itself. \
This results in stressing, due to the tidal bulge of the core and ocean moving beneath the crust, \
as well as the parent planet appearing to change its location in the sky. \n\n\

They are thought to be created when a fracture in the ice is propagated because of the stresses. \
In order for a cycloid to be created, the tensile stress at the location must exceed the tensile strength of the ice.\
Once the fracture has started, it will propagate through the ice at a certain velocity.\
This velocity could be constant, or could vary depending on the magnitude of the stress.\
During the cycloid's propagation, the satellite will continue orbiting around its primary.\
This causes the stress field on the satellite to change, making the cycloids curve.\
When the stress is no longer greater than the requisite propagation strength, the cycloid stops moving.\
If the stress reaches the propagation strength again, it will continue.\n\n\

- Tension on the map is shown as positive, and compression as negative.
- You can step through the plots by using the buttons to the bottom right of the graph.\n\
- Each individual plot can be saved by using the save button to the lower left of the graph, and the series can be saved using the "Save Series" \
button to the lower right.\n\
- The panel on the right allows manipulation of the map, changing the scale and type of map, as well as the stresses showed.\n\
- The bottom panel enables and disables cycloids.\n\
- When using Polar Wander, the initial and final locations of the rotational poles and/or sub- and anti-jove points will appear on the graph.\n\
  - The initial North and South poles will be white circles.\n\
  - The final North and South poles will be black circles.\n\
  - The initial sub- and anti-jove points will be white squares.\n\
  - The final sub- and anti-jove points will be black squares.\n\
- The vectors created by Polar Wander do not currently appear to be generating correctly.\n\
- When using cycloids, if the program is unable to initiate a cycloid, it will plot a black triangle at the attempted location.\n\
  - If it creates a split, but cannot propagate it, it will plot a white triangle at the location.\n\
- Cycloids can be saved as Shape files via the appropriate button.  Loading of shape files is currently not supported.\n\
- NOTE: The cycloids cannot be saved as netcdf files currently.\n\
- NOTE: The Lineaments features does not function currently.
